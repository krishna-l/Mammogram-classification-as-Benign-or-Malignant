# Mammogram-classification-as-Benign-or-Malignant
Classification of mammogram data as benign or malignant. We are going to use diffrent machine learning techniques and measure the accuracy using K-fold cross validation with k =10

We are going to apply the following techniques: 
1) Decision Trees
2) Random Forest
3) KNN
4) Naive Bayes
5) SVM
6) Linear Regression
7) ANN
